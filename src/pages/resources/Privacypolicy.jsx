                At Corporato, we are committed to protecting the privacy of our clients, partners, and website visitors. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your personal information when you interact with our website, services, and communications. By using our site or engaging with our consulting services, you consent to the practices outlined below.
                <br />
                <br />
                We collect personal information in several ways: when you visit our website, fill out a contact form, subscribe to updates, schedule a consultation, or engage in a formal advisory relationship. The types of information we may collect include your name, company affiliation, email address, phone number, job title, and any business-related data you voluntarily provide. We may also collect technical data such as IP address, browser type, device information, and usage patterns through cookies and analytics tools.
                <br />
                <br />
                Corporato uses this information to deliver tailored consulting services, respond to inquiries, improve our website experience, and communicate relevant updates. We may also use aggregated, anonymized data to analyze trends and enhance our strategic offerings. Your information helps us understand your business needs and deliver more effective solutions.
                We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information to third parties. However, we may share data with trusted service providers who assist us in operating our website, managing communications, or delivering client services â€” provided they agree to maintain confidentiality and comply with applicable data protection laws. In rare cases, we may disclose information if required by law, regulation, or legal process.
                <br />
                <br />
                Corporato takes data security seriously. We implement industry-standard safeguards to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction. This includes secure servers, encrypted communications, and restricted access protocols. While no system is entirely immune to risk, we continuously monitor and update our security practices to stay ahead of emerging threats.
                <br />
